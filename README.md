# Welcome to my ReadMe.md
I'm currently working on learning Javascript through (Zell Liew's JS Course)['https://zellwk.com/']. This repository is my record of my progression through the exercises and demo examples - as well as my own versions of the exercises to help challenge myself both in writing .js and comprehending the material given. 

## Markdown is really cool
This ReadMe file is also a small test playground for using Markdown to quickly style my text - will be helpful when I put effort into learning how to use Hugo and Jekyll to create static/dynamic websites without the use of Wordpress. 

### Thanks for following along. 
If you're from the Zell JS Course group - feel free to take a look through my code to see how I managed to accomplish things and how I explain the course material to myself. Hopefully it can help you too.
